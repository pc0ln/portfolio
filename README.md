# Personal Portfolio Site
This is the code to my personal portfolio site.
I used next js to build the app and tailwindcss to style a responsive app.
I used framer-motion to add some animation to the site.
I implimented the github api to fetch data from repos to create the projects tab and I used the sendgrid api to make a working contact form.
